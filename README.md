1. implementing target-action pattern for event handling
2. notifications with Notification Center

**[Change Text](https://github.com/SarinSwift/MOB1.3/tree/master/ChangeText)**

**[JSON in iOS](https://github.com/SarinSwift/MOB1.3/tree/master/Festival)**
- Read JSON data from a file
- Serializing a programs internal data structure into some kind of interchange formate using decode and encode
- Creating types conformin to the Codeable protocol (this allows us to create an encoder and decoder)
